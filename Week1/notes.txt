HTML, CSS & JavaScript - REACT: Front -end Development

Programming with JavaScript!
	
	Transition from Python!
	
	Mainly for Web Development - when it was developed...

	1. Desktop publishing languages - Calculator...(nothing to do with internet) - 	C, 	C++, C# , Java, Python
	2. Website development languages...Web browser... (not useful without internet) - 	HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ASP, PHP , JSP

Now, JavaScript is not only used for Website development BUT also we can develop desktop applications in JavaScript...
JavaScript was mainly for CLIENT SIDE Web development when it was born...BUT now JS is evenly powerful for doing SERVER SIDE Web development

SUMMARY: JavaScript can be used to develop: 1. Client Side website, 2. Server Side Websites, and 3. Desktop applications - Understand the Power of JS.

HOW TO RUN JS PROGRAM?
	1. By using Node js as console application - desktop...

One of the most popular progamming languages in the world.

JavaScript has many versions....its an evolving language...

ECMAScript (European Computer Manufacturers Association) which is the standads body repsonsible for JS language..
ES5, ES6, ES2015, ES2017... (advanced javascript)..

JS can also be termed as ES5-6...

JavaScript Syntax:

Features:
1. JS is Case-sensitive: name Name BOTH ARE DIFFERENT...
	customername, CustomerName ... DIFFERENT..
2. Naming is mostly used as "camelCase"..
	customerName, dateOfBirth,dateOfJoining...

Camel Case: customerName, dateOfBirth 	
Pascal Case: CustomerName, DateOfBirth
Snake Case: customer_name, date_of_birth
Kebab Case: customer-name, date-of-birth

3. Semi colons at the end of the statement are OPTIONAL..they mark the ending of an statment (statement terminators) ...A very good habbit is to ALWAYS use them...why? because MOST of the prog languages use them....
